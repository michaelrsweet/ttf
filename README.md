TTF - TrueType/OpenType Font Library
====================================

TTF is a simple C library for reading TrueType and OpenType font files.


Requirements
------------

You'll need a C compiler.


How to Incorporate in Your Project
----------------------------------

Add the `ttf.c` and `ttf.h` files to your project.  Include the `ttf.h`
header in any file that needs to read font files.


"Kicking the Tires"
-------------------

The supplied makefile allows you to build the unit tests on Linux and macOS (at
least), which verify that all of the functions work as expected to read some
sample font files in the `testfiles` directory:

    make test
